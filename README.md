# Electromagnetically-induced-transparency
This project explores the phenomenon of "Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT)" using a quantum mechanical model of a three-level atomic system. EIT is a fascinating interference effect that renders an otherwise opaque medium transparent to a probe laser under specific quantum coherence conditions.
