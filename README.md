# Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) â€“ Quantum Simulation

This project explores the phenomenon of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) using a quantum mechanical model of a three-level atomic system. EIT is an interference effect that renders an otherwise opaque medium transparent to a probe laser under specific quantum coherence conditions.

## Project Overview

- Simulates the density matrix evolution of a 3-level atomic system
- Solves the master equation under the rotating wave approximation
- Visualizes absorption spectra and transparency windows
- Investigates how Rabi frequencies, detunings, and decoherence affect the system

## Methods

- Numerical solution of the Lindblad master equation
- Visualization of population dynamics and coherence terms
- Python libraries used: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## Key Features

- Dynamic control of probe and coupling fields
- Comparison of absorption with and without coupling laser
- Simulation of EIT effect and spectral profiles
